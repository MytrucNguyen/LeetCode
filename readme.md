| 1 | <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/"> Two Sum</a> | <a href="https://github.com/MytrucNguyen/LeetCode/blob/main/Python/1-Two_Sum.py">Python</a> | Easy | Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. <br>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. <br>You can return the answer in any order. |
| 2 | <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/">Two Sum</a> | <a href="https://github.com/MytrucNguyen/LeetCode/blob/main/Python/7-Reverse_Integer.py">Python</a> | Easy | Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. <br>If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0. <br><br>Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned). |

| 26 | <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/">Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array</a> | <a href="https://github.com/MytrucNguyen/LeetCode/blob/main/JavaScript/26-RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedArray.js">JavaScript</a> | Easy | Given an integer array nums sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. <br>Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements. <br>Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums. <br>Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array** in-place with O(1) extra memory. |
| 28 | <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/">Implement strStr()</a> | <a href="https://github.com/MytrucNguyen/LeetCode/blob/main/JavaScript/28-ImplementStrStr.js">JavaScript</a> | Easy | Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack. <br>**Clarification**: What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview. <br>For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf(). |
| 33 | <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/">Search in Rotated Sorted Array</a> | <a href="https://github.com/MytrucNguyen/LeetCode/blob/main/JavaScript/33-searchAnElementInASortedAndRotatedArray.js">JavaScript</a> | Medium | There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). <br>Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]. <br>Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums. <br>You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.|

To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.|
